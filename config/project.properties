# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties
# Explaination: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values. 
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.

# Directory Structure
#
# Override any directory paths specific to this project
#
# dir.publish
# dir.js
# dir.js.libs
# dir.js.mylibs
# dir.css
# dir.images


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatonated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatonated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the last entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets	= css1.css, css2.css, style.css
#
file.stylesheets				= 


# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form
file.pages						= 	



# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a 
# comma separated list
file.exclude				=
