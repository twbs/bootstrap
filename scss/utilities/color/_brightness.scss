// Computes the "brightness" of a color
//
// Brightness is similiar to lightness in HSL but more closely approximates
// how humans perceive the intensity of the different RGB components of
// a color. Brightness is sometimes called luminance.
//
// Returns a number between 0% and 100%, where 100% is fully bright
// (white) and 0% is fully dark (black) for color values.
