title: Visibility
description: Control the visibility of elements, without modifying their display, with visibility utilities.
---

Set the `visibility` of elements with our visibility utilities. These utility classes do not modify the `display` value at all and do not affect layout â€“ `.invisible` elements still take up space in the page.

<Callout type="warning">
Elements with the `.invisible` class will be hidden *both* visually and for assistive technology/screen reader users.
</Callout>

Apply `.visible` or `.invisible` as needed.

```html
<div class="visible">...</div>
<div class="invisible">...</div>
```

```scss
// Class
.visible {
  visibility: visible !important;
}
.invisible {
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
```
