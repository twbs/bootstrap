<h3>Basic</h3>

You can create an accordion using minimal markup like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_accordion_basic}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_accordion_basic_rendered}}
  </div>
</div>

<div class="panel"><p>Note: Accordion used to require ```<dl>``` and ```<dd>``` markup. It now works with ```<ul>```'s and ```<li>```'s as well. You need v5.5+ to use the newer markup.</p></div>

***

<h3>Distributed accordion groups</h3>

You can name the accordion so that it can be spread across different parent containers.  In this example the accordion is named *myAccordionGroup* and it is split between different columns in a block grid.  This allows the accordion to be responsive to screen width.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_accordion_grid}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_accordion_grid}}
  </div>
</div>

***

## Accessibility

For accessible accordions use the markup below, which adds a some of ARIA attributes and roles. Some attributes are automatically added and toggled by the JavaScript.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_accordion_aria}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_accordion_aria}}
  </div>
</div>

***

### Callbacks

There are two ways to bind to callbacks in your tabs.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
<h4>Callback function</h4>
```html
<script>
  $(document).foundation({
    accordion: {
      callback : function (accordion) {
        console.log(accordion);
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
<h4>Toggled Event</h4>
```html
<script>
  $('#myAccordionGroup').on('toggled', function (event, accordion) {
    console.log(accordion);
  });
</script>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

***

## Customize with Sass

Accordions can be easily customized with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

## Configure With Javascript

It's easy to configure dropdowns using our provided Javascript. You can use data-attributes or plain old Javascript. Make sure `jquery.js`, `foundation.js` and `foundation.accordion.js` have been included on your page before continuing. For example, add the following before the closing `<body>` tag:

{{#markdown}}
  ```html
<script src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation/foundation.js"></script>
<script src="js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js"></script>
  ```
{{/markdown}}

### Optional Javascript Configuration

#### JS

{{#markdown}}
```js
$(document).foundation({
  accordion: {
    // specify the class used for accordion panels
    content_class: 'content',
    // specify the class used for active (or open) accordion panels
    active_class: 'active',
    // allow multiple accordion panels to be active at the same time
    multi_expand: false,
    // allow accordion panels to be closed by clicking on their headers
    // setting to false only closes accordion panels when another is opened
    toggleable: true
  }
});
```
{{/markdown}}

***

### Adding New Accordion Content After Page Load

If you add new content after the page has been loaded, you will need to reinitialize the Foundation JavaScript by running the following:

{{#markdown}}
```javascript
$(document).foundation(); 
```
{{/markdown}}

Reflow will make Foundation check the DOM for any elements and re-apply any listeners to them.

{{#markdown}}
```javascript
$(document).foundation('accordion', 'reflow');
```
{{/markdown}}

***

## Semantic Markup With Sass Mixins

You can use the a `accordion-container()`, `accordion-navigation`, and `accordion-navigation` mixins to create your own accordion with semantic markup, like so:


<div class="row">
  <div class="large-12 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
.your-accordion-class  {
  @include accordion-container;

  .your-accordion-navigation-class  {
    @include accordion-navigation;
  }

  .your-accordion-content-class  {
    @include accordion-content;
  }
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>
##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

```scss
@import "foundation/components/accordion";
```
