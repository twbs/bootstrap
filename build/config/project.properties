# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css, lightbox.css, plugin.css
#
file.root.stylesheet    = bootstrap.css

# Pages to scan
file.pages.include = index.html, 404.html, sample.html

# Optional property used to determine the specific LESS file to be used
#  styles.less.path refers to the path in which your less file is located
#   Example: styles.less.path = less
styles.less.path = less
#   styles.less.filename refers to the main LESS file to be compiled, otherwise style.less is the main filename
#  Example: styles.less.filename = main.less
styles.less.filename = bootstrap.less
#  styles.less.outputfilename is the name of the file to be ouput, if not set it is style.css
#  Example: styles.less.outputfilename = style.less.css
# styles.less.outputfilename =

# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form
file.pages        =

# Root script to concatenate
file.root.script    = bootstrap.min.js

# site manifest for offline
# this is the name of the manifest file you declared in the <html> tag
# Uncomment this line to enable appcache generation:
# file.manifest    = manifest.appcache

# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.
# Example: file.exclude = badfolder/**
file.exclude      = **/less/**, **/settings/**

# Bypassed JavaScript files and dirs
#
# Add any files or folders within the js directory that you want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files will not be concatenated or minimized and will simply be copied over as is.
# Note: you cannot declare an empty file.bypass property
# Example:
# file.js.bypass = widgets.js, gadgets.js, gidgets.js
# file.js.bypass = ../extras/chosen/chosen.jquery.min.js, ../extras/prettify/prettify.js, ../extras/h5bp/js/libs/modernizr-2.5.3.min.js, bootstrap.min.js

# Closure Compiler Options
#
# options are WHITESPACE_ONLY, SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS, ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS
# scripts.compilation.level =  SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS
# options are QUIET DEFAULT AND VERBOSE
# scripts.compilation.warninglevel = QUIET

#
# Specify an environment to build
#
# By Default, it builds a production environment
# Set to dev if building a development environment
# Set to test if building a test environment
env               =

#
# Bypass Optimization for these image files or folders
#
# images.bypass
# If set, these images will not be optimized
# Note: you cannot declare an empty images.bypass property, it would exclude the entire img folder from being optimized

# Directory Structure
#
# Override any directory paths specific to this project
#
# dir.publish
# dir.js
# dir.js.libs
# dir.css
# dir.images

# Override default JSHint Options (see http://jshint.com/ for description of options)
#tool.jshint.opts =

# Override default JSLint Options (see http://www.jslint.com/lint.html for description of options)
#tool.jslint.opts =

# Override default CSSLint Options (see http://csslint.net/about.html#settings for description of options)
#tool.csslint.opts =

# Override default htmlcompressor options 
#tool.htmlcompressor.opts    = --remove-quotes --preserve-multi-spaces --compress-css --preserve-php --preserve-ssi

#
# Image Optimisation
#
# images.strip.metadata       = true
# Seting this to true will strip the metadata from all jpeg and png files.
# YOU SHOULD ONLY DO THIS IF YOU OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO ALL THE IMAGES IN THE BUILD


# uncomment to enable inline JavaScript compression. For now we've disabled it to protect against errors generated with template script tags.
# tool.htmlcompressor.javascript = --compress-js 

# Add optional htmlcompressor options
tool.htmlcompressor.opts.extra =   

# set the hash length used for versioning css and js files.
# valid values are between 1 and 40.
# shorter values use less bytes at the expense of increasing the probability of a hash collision.
#hash.length = 7

# Optional property used to determine whether to include requirejs' implementation of <script> in the build process
# Uncomment and include the path
#	Example: script.require.path = js/libs/require-jquery.js
# script.require.path =
