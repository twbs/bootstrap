  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="jquery-required">
    <h4>jQuery required</h4>
    <p>Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong> to be included, as shown in the <a href="#template">starter template</a>. <a href="{{ site.repo }}/blob/v3-dev/bower.json">Consult our <code>bower.json</code></a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.</p>

  <p>This is the most basic form of Bootstrap: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap.*</code>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap.min.*</code>). CSS <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps">source maps</a> (<code>bootstrap.*.map</code>) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-source">Bootstrap source code</h2>
  <p>The Bootstrap source code download includes the precompiled CSS, JavaScript, and font assets, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:</p>
{% highlight text %}
bootstrap/
├── less/
├── js/
├── fonts/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── fonts/
└── docs/
    └── examples/
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The <code>less/</code>, <code>js/</code>, and <code>fonts/</code> are the source code for our CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). The <code>dist/</code> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <code>docs/</code> folder includes the source code for our documentation, and <code>examples/</code> of Bootstrap usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
