<h3 class="subheader">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the default 12-column, nest-able Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</h3>

***

<h3>Basic</h3>

Start by adding an element with a class of `row`. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add divs with a `column` class within that row. You can use `column` or `columns` - the only difference is grammar. Specify the widths of each column with the small-#, medium-#, and large-# classes.

**Foundation is mobile-first**. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.

### Small Grid

Small grids expand to large screens easier than large grids cram into small screens.

***

### Medium Grid

Medium sized screens will inherit styles from small, unless you specify a different layout, using the medium grid classes.

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can nest the grids indefinitely, though at a certain point it will get absurd.

### Offsets

Move blocks up to 11 columns to the right by using classes like `.large-offset-1` and `.small-offset-3`.

### Incomplete Rows

In order to work around browsers' different rounding behaviors, Foundation will float the last column in a row to the right so the edge aligns. If your row doesn't have a count that adds up to 12 columns, you can tag the last column with a class of `end` in order to override that behavior.

### Collapse/Uncollapse Rows

The `collapse` class lets you remove column gutters (padding).

There are times when you won't want each media query to be collapsed or uncollapsed. In this case, use the media query size you want and collapse or uncollapse and add that to your `row` element. Example shows no gutter at small media size and then adds the gutter to columns at medium.

### Centered Columns

Center your columns by adding a class of `small-centered` to your `column`. Large will inherit small centering by default, but you can also center solely on large by applying a `large-centered` class. To uncenter on large screens use `large-uncentered`.

### Source Ordering

Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means if you place sub-navigation below main content on small displays, you have the option to position the sub-navigation on either the left or right of the page for large displays. Prefix push/pull with the size of the device you want to apply the styles to. `medium-push-#`, `large-push-#` is the syntax you'll use. Use `large-reset-order` to reset pushed or pulled columns to their original position on large screens.

## Customize with Sass

Customizing the grid is easy with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_variables}}

<h3>Basic</h3>

You can use the `grid-row()` and `grid-column()` mixins to create your own rows and columns with semantic markup, like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-row-class {
  @include grid-row();
  .custom-column-class {
    @include grid-column(12);
  }
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_grid_row_mixin}}
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can further customize your grid columns using the provided options in the `grid-column()` mixin:

##### Row Mixin Options

{{> examples_grid_row_options}}

##### Column Mixin Options

{{> examples_grid_column_mixin}}

***

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/grid";
```
{{/markdown}}
