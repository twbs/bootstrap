## Example

Use `z-index` utilities to stack elements on top of one another. Requires a `position` value other than `static`, which can be set with custom styles or using our [position utilities]([[docsref:/utilities/position/]]).

<Callout>
We call these “low-level” `z-index` utilities because of their default values of `-1` through `3`, which we use for the layout of overlapping components. High-level `z-index` values are used for overlay components like modals and tooltips.
</Callout>

<Example class="bd-example-zindex-levels position-relative" code={`<div class="z-3 position-absolute p-5 rounded-3"><span>z-3</span></div>
<div class="z-2 position-absolute p-5 rounded-3"><span>z-2</span></div>
<div class="z-1 position-absolute p-5 rounded-3"><span>z-1</span></div>
<div class="z-0 position-absolute p-5 rounded-3"><span>z-0</span></div>
<div class="z-n1 position-absolute p-5 rounded-3"><span>z-n1</span></div>`} />

## Overlays

Bootstrap overlay components—dropdown, modal, offcanvas, popover, toast, and tooltip—all have their own `z-index` values to ensure a usable experience with competing “layers” of an interface.

Read about them in the [`z-index` layout page]([[docsref:/layout/z-index]]).

## Component approach

On some components, we use our low-level `z-index` values to manage repeating elements that overlap one another (like buttons in a button group or items in a list group).

Learn about our [`z-index` approach]([[docsref:/extend/approach#z-index-scales]]).
