TWITTER BOOTSTRAP
=================

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more.

To get started -- checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!


Usage
-----

You can use Twitter Bootstrap in one of two ways: just drop the compiled CSS into any new project and start cranking, or run LESS on your site and compile on the fly like a boss.

Here's what the LESS version looks like:

    <link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="lib/bootstrap.less">
    <script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Or if you prefer, the standard css way:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap-1.0.0.css">

For more info, refer to the docs!
