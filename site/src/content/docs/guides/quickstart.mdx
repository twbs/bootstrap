description: The official guide for how to include Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript in your project using a CDN.
---

Get started using Bootstrap in seconds by including our production-ready CSS and JavaScript by [using a CDN]([[docsref:/getting-started/install#cdn]]) without the need for any build steps. CDNs provide copies of Bootstrap's codebase that's ready to be used in any environment with minimal code changes required on your part.

1. **Create a new `index.html` file in your project root.** Include the `<meta name="viewport">` tag as well for [proper responsive behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/viewport) in mobile devices.

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
       <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS.** Place the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` for our CSS, and the `<script>` tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips) before the closing `</body>`. Learn more about our [CDN links]([[docsref:/getting-started/install#cdn]]).

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
       <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
       <link href="[[config:cdn.css]]" rel="stylesheet" integrity="[[config:cdn.css_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"> // [!code ++]
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
       <script src="[[config:cdn.js_bundle]]" integrity="[[config:cdn.js_bundle_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> // [!code ++]
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   You can also include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/) and our JS separately. If you don’t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including Popper.

   ```html
   <script src="[[config:cdn.popper]]" integrity="[[config:cdn.popper_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   <script src="[[config:cdn.js]]" integrity="[[config:cdn.js_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```

3. **Hello, world!** Open the page in your browser of choice to see your Bootstrapped page. Now you can start building with Bootstrap by creating your own [layout]([[docsref:/layout/grid]]), adding dozens of [components]([[docsref:/components/buttons]]), and utilizing [our official examples]([[docsref:/examples]]).
