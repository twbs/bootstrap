### Basic

You can create a table using minimal markup.

#### HTML

{{#markdown}}
```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="200">Table Header</th>
      <th>Table Header</th>
      <th width="150">Table Header</th>
      <th width="150">Table Header</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
      <td>This is longer content Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.</td>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
      <td>This is longer Content Goes Here Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.</td>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
      <td>This is longer Content Goes Here Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.</td>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
      <td>Content Goes Here</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
{{/markdown}}

## Accessibility

Tables have a lot of handy built-in features to make them more usable with screen readers. The key thing to remember is that *vision-impaired users can't quickly scan a table like sighted users can*. Typically, screen readers will read out the contents of a table one row at a time. Simpler tables with clear hierarchy and organization will be more easy to use for vision-impaired users.

Here are some things you can do to make your tables more accessible:

### Define tables for data

Tables should almost always be used for actual data and not for creating page layouts. (You're using our awesome grid for layout anyway, *right?*) When a screen reader encounters a table, it runs a series of tests to determine if the table is a layout table or data table. The easiest way to define a table as being for data is by using `<th>` tags to define the headers of the table. Newer assistive software will also immediately interpret any table with the attribute `role="grid"` as being for data.

```html
<table role="grid">
  <!-- ... -->
</table>
```

### Add a summary

The contents of a table can be described using the `<caption>` tag. However, you can also add the `summary` attribute to a table to further clarify its use. The `summary` attribute is specifically designed to explain a table to a vision-impaired user. If a table has both a summary and a caption, the summary should not simply restate the caption.

The W3C offers [this example](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H73.html) for a table detailing a bus schedule:

```html
<table summary="Schedule for Route 7 going downtown. Service begins 
at 4:00 AM and ends at midnight. Intersections are listed in the top row. 
Find the intersection closest to your starting point or destination, then read 
down that column to find out what time the bus leaves that intersection.">
  <tr>
    <th>State & First</th>
    <th>State & Sixth</th>
    <th>State & Fifteenth</th>
    <th>Fifteenth & Morrison</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4:00</td>
    <td>4:05</td>
    <td>4:11</td>
    <td>4:19</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- ... -->
</table>
```

### Building complex tables

Most accessibility groups recommend keeping tables simple if accessibility is a concern. A complex table could potentially be split into multiple, smaller tables instead of being kept together. That being said, when creating a complex table, there are a few things to keep in mind.

Always use `<th>` to define the headers for columns and rows. If a header cell is not a `<th>`, but a `<td>`, use the `scope` attribute to explain what kind of heading the cell is:
  - `scope="row"` means the cell is a header for the row it's inside.
  - `scope="column"` means the cell is a header for the column it's inside.

```html
<table>
  <caption>Most Expensive Sandwiches by City</caption>
  <tr>
    <th scope="column">Rank</th>
    <th scope="column">City</th>
    <th scope="column">Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">Campbell, CA</td>
    <td scope="row">New York, NY</td>
    <td scope="row">Sandwich, IL</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$12.99</td>
    <td>$9.99</td>
    <td>$8.99</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

If a cell has multiple headers, use the `headers` attribute on the cell to define them. Give each header a unique ID, and then write the ID of each header in the `headers` attribute of the cell. Separate multiple headers with a space.

```html
<table>
  <caption>Cute Animals Per 1,000 People</caption>
  <tr>
    <th id="state">State</th>
    <th id="dogs">Dogs</th>
    <th id="cats">Cats</th>
    <th id="rabbits">Rabbits</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="california" headers="state">California</th>
    <td headers="dogs california">3</td>
    <td headers="cats california">1</td>
    <td headers="rabbits california">10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Customize with Sass

Tables can be easily customized using our Sass variables.

**Note:** `rem-calc();` is a function we wrote to convert `px` to `rem`. It is included in **_functions.scss**.

### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/tables";
```
{{/markdown}}
