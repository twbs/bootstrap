## Overview

Bootstrap provides `.pe-none` and `.pe-auto` classes to prevent or add element interactions through the `pointer-events` CSS property.

## Basic usage

<Example code={`<p><a href="#" class="pe-none" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="pe-auto">This link</a> can be clicked (this is default behavior).</p>
<p class="pe-none"><a href="#" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked because the <code>pointer-events</code> property is inherited from its parent. However, <a href="#" class="pe-auto">this link</a> has a <code>pe-auto</code> class and can be clicked.</p>`} />

## Important considerations

The `.pe-none` class (and the `pointer-events` CSS property it sets) only prevents interactions with a pointer (mouse, stylus, touch). Links and controls with `.pe-none` are, by default, still focusable and actionable for keyboard users.

To ensure that they are completely neutralized even for keyboard users, you may need to add further attributes such as:
- `tabindex="-1"` (to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus)
- `aria-disabled="true"` (to convey the fact they are effectively disabled to assistive technologies)
- JavaScript to completely prevent them from being actionable

## Better alternatives

If possible, the simpler solution is:

- **For form controls**: Add the `disabled` HTML attribute
- **For links**: Remove the `href` attribute, making it a non-interactive anchor or placeholder link

<Callout type="warning">
**Accessibility warning:** Using `pointer-events: none` can create accessibility barriers. Always ensure that disabled elements are properly marked up with appropriate ARIA attributes and that keyboard users can't accidentally focus them.
</Callout>

## Use cases

- **`.pe-none`** - Disable interactions on overlays, loading states, or temporarily disabled elements
- **`.pe-auto`** - Re-enable interactions on child elements when parent has `pe-none`
