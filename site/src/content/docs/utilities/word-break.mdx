Prevent long strings of text from breaking your components' layout by using `.text-break` to set `word-wrap: break-word` and `word-break: break-word`. We use `word-wrap` instead of the more common `overflow-wrap` for wider browser support, and add the deprecated `word-break: break-word` to avoid issues with flex containers.

<Example code={`<p class="text-break">mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm</p>`} />

<Callout type="warning">
Note that [breaking words isn't possible in Arabic](https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling#3.-line-break), which is the most used RTL language. Therefore `.text-break` is removed from our RTL compiled CSS.
