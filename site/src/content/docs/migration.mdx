## v6.0.0 Migration

Bootstrap 6 is a major release with many breaking changes to modernize our codebase, adopt newer build tools, and improve customization. Keep reading for a guide on how to migrate from v5 to v6, and a full changelog of what's new.

1. Bump your Bootstrap dependency:

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "bootstrap": "^6.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

2. If using all of Bootstrap's Sass files, include it in your Sass using `@use`:

   ```scss
   @use "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
   ```

   With this, you can then easily override Bootstrap's Sass variables and maps:

   ```scss
   @use "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap" with (
    $spacer: 1rem,
    $enable-reduced-motion: true,
   );
   ```

3. If using only certain parts of Bootstrap's Sass files, you can use `@use` to import them individually. Be aware that our Sass file structure has changed and you may need to adjust your imports accordingly.

   ```scss
   @use "bootstrap/scss/forms";
   ```

4. Update HTML and CSS per the changelog and updates in the documentation.

5. Recompile your Sass to see the changes.

## v6.0.0 Changelog

### CSS

- **Implemented CSS layers** in `_root.scss` and applied them to all our Sass files.
  - Layers are set in `_root.scss` and then utilized across separate Sass partials.
  - We cannot, unfortunately, wrap `@use` or `@forward` statements in `@layer`—Sass expects those to be top level at all times. Also, while CSS allows `@import "file.css" layer(name)`, Sass also does not support that.
- Clarified and simplified CSS-Sass setup.
- New, streamlined color modes and theming.
  - Removed `_maps.scss`
  - Removed `_variables-dark.scss`
  - Added `_colors.scss`, splitting them out from `_variables.scss`,
  - Added `_theme.scss` where we setup all our global theming for how colors are applied
- **Updated lg, xl, and 2xl breakpoints and containers.**
  - Increased the `lg` breakpoint from 992px to 1024px; it's container remains the same at 960px.
  - Increased the `xl` breakpoint from 1200px to 1280px, and it's container from 1140px to 1200px.
  - Renamed `xxl` to `2xl` for better scaling with additional custom breakpoints
  - Increased the `2xl` breakpoint from 1400px to 1536px, and it's container from 1320px to 1440px.

### Sass

- Dropped support for Node Sass, including no longer testing any of our source CSS against it.
  - Rearranged several Sass files in the process.
- Removed `add()` and `subtract()` functions. Use `calc()` instead.
- **Removes all deprecated Sass variables and values:**
  - Removed `$variable-prefix`, use `$prefix` instead.
  - Removed `$nested-kbd-font-weight`, no replacement.
  - Removed `muted`, `black-50`, and `white-50` from text colors utilities map
  - Consolidated carousel dark variables, removing `$carousel-dark-indicator-active-bg`, `$carousel-dark-caption-color`, and `$carousel-dark-control-icon-filter` for their reassigned counterparts.
  - Removed `$btn-close-white-filter` for `$btn-close-filter-dark`.
  - Removed `$border-radius-2xl`, use `$border-radius-xxl`.
  - Removed `$text-muted` for secondary color.
  - Removed `$hr-bg-color` for `$hr-border-color` and `$hr-height` for `$hr-border-width`.
  - Removed unused `$dropdown-header-padding` for the `-x`/`-y` split variables.
  - Removed unused `$accordion-button-focus-border-color`.
  - Removed unused `$tooltip-arrow-color`.
  - Removed unused `$popover-arrow-color` and `$popover-arrow-outer-color`
  - Removed unused `$alert-bg-scale`, `$alert-border-scale`, and `$alert-color-scale` (replaced by theme tokens)
  - Removed unused `$list-group-item-bg-scale` and `$list-group-item-color-scale` (replaced by theme tokens)

### Reboot

- Relocated heading classes (like `.h1`) and some type classes (`.mark` and `.small`) to Reboot from `_type.scss`. This avoids a dependency in Sass modules and we like to avoid extending selectors in general.

### Forms

- **Refactor checks, radios, and switches.**
  - Split apart `_form-check.scss` into separate stylesheets: `_checkbox.scss`, `_radio.scss`, and `_switch.scss`.
  - Also split apart the documentation pages for checks, radios, and switches.
  - Added new CSS variables on each of these components. _Side note: we could've shared variables here, but chose not to for simplicity's sake._
  - Removed several now unused Sass variables.
  - Checkboxes now have a wrapping element and an SVG in the DOM for checked and indeterminate states. Radios and switches do not.
  - Revamped layout for checks, radios, and switches with labels (and descriptions). We now have custom elements for layout that include basic flexbox styling.
  - @mdo-do: Decide on fate of `.form-check-reverse` and `.btn-check`
- **Consolidate `.form-select` into `.form-control`.**
  - Removed `.form-select`—use `.form-control` on `<select>` elements now. Too much abstraction and duplication at the same time.
  - Adds new CSS variables on `.form-control` for easier customization without Sass compilation.
  - `.form-control` now has a `min-height` at all times as opposed to just on `<textarea>` elements. This reduces some CSS for us.

### Helpers

- Ratio helpers have been moved to utilities.
- Dropped clearfix helper for `.d-flow-root` utility.

### Utilities

- Ratio helpers are now powered by the utility API and use simplified values without `calc()`.
- mdo-do: Need to refactor utilities API if we want to restore the commented out custom ratios.
- **Display utilities:** added `flow-root` option for a modern clearfix.
- **Sizing utilities:**
  - Renamed `.mh-*`/`.mw-*` to `.max-h-*`/`.max-w-*`
  - Added `.min-h-*` and `.min-w-*` utilities with two default values, `0` and `100%`
  - Added `auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and `fit-content` to `width` and `height` utilities.
- **Flex & Grid utilities:**
  - Added `.place-items` and `.justify-items` utilities.

### Docs

- Removed all `AddedIn` badges.
- Rearranged utilities documentation to break apart larger pages that included groups of utilities. Sizing, spacing, flex, type, and more have been broken out into smaller pages with new sub-group headings in the sidebar.
