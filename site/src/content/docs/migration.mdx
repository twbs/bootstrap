## v6.0.0

### CSS

- **Implemented CSS layers** in `_root.scss` and applied them to all our Sass files.
  - Layers are set in `_root.scss` and then utilized across separate Sass partials.
  - We cannot, unfortunately, wrap `@use` or `@forward` statements in `@layer`â€”Sass expects those to be top level at all times. Also, while CSS allows `@import "file.css" layer(name)`, Sass also does not support that.
- Clarified and simplified CSS-Sass setup.
- New, streamlined color modes and theming.
  - Removed `_maps.scss`
  - Removed `_variables-dark.scss`
  - Added `_colors.scss`, splitting them out from `_variables.scss`,
  - Added `_theme.scss` where we setup all our global theming for how colors are applied

### Sass

- Dropped support for Node Sass, including no longer testing any of our source CSS against it.
  - Rearranged several Sass files in the process.
- Removed `add()` and `subtract()` functions. Use `calc()` instead.
- **Removes all deprecated Sass variables and values:**
  - Removed `$variable-prefix`, use `$prefix` instead.
  - Removed `$nested-kbd-font-weight`, no replacement.
  - Removed `muted`, `black-50`, and `white-50` from text colors utilities map
  - Consolidated carousel dark variables, removing `$carousel-dark-indicator-active-bg`, `$carousel-dark-caption-color`, and `$carousel-dark-control-icon-filter` for their reassigned counterparts.
  - Removed `$btn-close-white-filter` for `$btn-close-filter-dark`.
  - Removed `$border-radius-2xl`, use `$border-radius-xxl`.
  - Removed `$text-muted` for secondary color.
  - Removed `$hr-bg-color` for `$hr-border-color` and `$hr-height` for `$hr-border-width`.
  - Removed unused `$dropdown-header-padding` for the `-x`/`-y` split variables.
  - Removed unused `$accordion-button-focus-border-color`.
  - Removed unused `$tooltip-arrow-color`.
  - Removed unused `$popover-arrow-color` and `$popover-arrow-outer-color`
  - Removed unused `$alert-bg-scale`, `$alert-border-scale`, and `$alert-color-scale` (replaced by theme tokens)
  - Removed unused `$list-group-item-bg-scale` and `$list-group-item-color-scale` (replaced by theme tokens)

### Reboot

- Relocated heading classes (like `.h1`) and some type classes (`.mark` and `.small`) to Reboot from `_type.scss`. This avoids a dependency in Sass modules and we like to avoid extending selectors in general.

### Helpers

- Ratio helpers have been moved to utilities.
- Dropped clearfix helper for `.d-flow-root` utility.

### Utilities

- Ratio helpers are now powered by the utility API and use simplified values without `calc()`.
- mdo-do: Need to refactor utilities API if we want to restore the commented out custom ratios.
- **Display utilities:** added `flow-root` option for a modern clearfix.
- **Sizing utilities:**
  - Renamed `.mh-*`/`.mw-*` to `.max-h-*`/`.max-w-*`
  - Added `.min-h-*` and `.min-w-*` utilities with two default values, `0` and `100%`
  - Added `auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and `fit-content` to `width` and `height` utilities.
- **Flex & Grid utilities:**
  - Added `.place-items` and `.justify-items` utilities.

### Docs

- Removed all `AddedIn` badges.
- Rearranged utilities documentation to break apart larger pages that included groups of utilities. Sizing, spacing, flex, type, and more have been broken out into smaller pages with new sub-group headings in the sidebar.
