It's easy to configure Magellan using our provided Javascript. You can use with data-attributes or plain old Javascript. Make sure `jquery.js`, `foundation.js`, and `foundation.magellan.js` have been included on your page before continuing. For example, add the following before the closing `<body>` tag:

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{> examples_magellan_javascript}}

<h3>Basic</h3>

Using data-attributes is the preferred method of making changes to our Javascript.

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{> examples_magellan_library}}

***

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can adjust lots of settings. For example:

#### JS

{{> examples_magellan_options}}

### Adding New Content After Page Load

If you add new content after the page has been loaded, you will need to reinitialize the Foundation JavaScript by running the following:

{{#markdown}}
```javascript
$(document).foundation(); 
```
{{/markdown}}

Reflow will make Foundation check the DOM for any elements and re-apply any listeners to them.

{{#markdown}}
```javascript
$(document).foundation('magellan', 'reflow');
```
{{/markdown}}

***

### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/magellan";
```
{{/markdown}}
