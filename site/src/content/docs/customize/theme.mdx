## How it works

Theme colors are defined in the `$new-theme-colors` Sass map. This map is used to generate our theme color values. You'll find these values in the `_theme.scss` file. These are where we define our design tokens for Bootstrap, across both light and dark color modes.

## Theme colors

Theme colors include the following semantic colors:

<BsTable>
| Theme color | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `primary` | Main brand color for primary actions |
| `accent` | Secondary brand color (new in v6) |
| `success` | Positive actions and successful states |
| `danger` | Destructive actions and error states |
| `warning` | Cautionary messages and warning states |
| `info` | Informational messages and neutral states |
| `secondary` | Less prominent secondary actions |
</BsTable>

Within each semantic theme color, you'll find the following color-mode responsive keys:

<BsTable>
| Theme token | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `base` | The default color value for the semantic color |
| `text` | Accessible text color (against body, plus `subtle` and `muted` color tokens) |
| `bg` | For solid colored backgrounds with high contrast |
| `bg-subtle` | Lowest contrast backgrounds, usually paired with `text` key for text color |
| `bg-muted` | Lower contrast backgrounds, often used for disabled states |
| `border` | Borders and dividers |
| `focus-ring` | For visible focus indicators and outline styles |
| `contrast` | Text color that needs to be readable on the `base` and `bg` colors |
</BsTable>

## Theme Sass map

We use a large, nested Sass map to generate our theme color values.

<ScssDocs name="theme-colors" file="scss/_theme.scss" />

## CSS variables

CSS variables are generated from the `$new-theme-colors` Sass map at the `:root` level inside `_root.scss` using a Sass loop.

<ScssDocs name="root-theme-variables" file="scss/_root.scss" />
