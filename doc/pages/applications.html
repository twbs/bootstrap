<h3 class="subheader">We use Rails to develop our own apps and Foundation helps us do it so much quicker. You can start using Foundation in your projects by following these instructions.</h3>

***
##Rails Application

### Add Foundation to your Rails app

You can use the `foundation-rails` gem to make it super easy to use Foundation in your upcoming Rails project. Just add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'foundation-rails'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

### Configuring Foundation

You can run the following command to add Foundation:

```bash
rails g foundation:install
```

***

## Manual Installation

### Add Foundation to your CSS

Append the following line to your `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` file:

```css
/*= require foundation */
```

If you're planning on using Sass, then you'll want to rename `application.css` to `application.scss`. That file should then look like:

```css
@import "foundation_and_overrides";
/* Add imports of custom sass/scss files here */
```

### Add Foundation to your JS

Append the following lines to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file:

```js
//= require foundation
$(document).foundation();
```
### Configure Asset pipeline

Add Modernizr to precompiled assets for production in `config/initializers/assets.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( vendor/modernizr.js )
```

For Rails version < 4.2.0, add Modernizr in `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.assets.precompile += %w( vendor/modernizr.js )
```

### Add Modernizr

Make sure that Modernizr is included in the `<head>` of your page:

```ruby
javascript_include_tag "vendor/modernizr"
```

### Set Viewport Width

Add the following line to the `<head>` of your page layout:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```
