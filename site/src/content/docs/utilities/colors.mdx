## Colors

Colorize text with color utilities. If you want to colorize links, you can use the [`.link-*` helper classes]([[docsref:/helpers/colored-links]]) which have `:hover` and `:focus` states.

- Colors are generated from the `$new-theme-colors` Sass map with a `theme-color-values()` function that looks up semantic colors based on a particular key from the Bootstrap theme config.
- Additional colors are generated from the separate `$theme-texts` Sass map.
- Text utilities are generated in a two-step process to allow for dynamic alpha transparency changes:
  - We generate an attribute utility for classes that include `.color-`, which looks like `[class*="color-"]`, and set `color: var(--bs-color)`.
  - Then, our specific color utilities set the `--bs-color` CSS variable to the color value.
- Text utilities don't set `background-color`, so you may need to use `.bg-` [background utilities]([[docsref:/utilities/background]]) for proper contrast.
- Lastly, most color utilities are responsive to color mode changes. This excludes inherit as there's no need, plus white and black as these exist for ease of common translucent colors.

Here are the available color utilities:

<Example code={[
  ...getData('theme-colors').map((themeColor) => `<div class="mb-2 color-${themeColor.name}${themeColor.contrast_color ? ` bg-${themeColor.contrast_color}` : ``}">.color-${themeColor.name}</div>`),
  `<div class="mb-2 color">.color</div>
<div class="mb-2 color-1">.color-1</div>
<div class="mb-2 color-2">.color-2</div>
<div class="mb-2 color-3">.color-3</div>

<div class="mb-2 color-black bg-white">.color-black</div>
<div class="mb-2 color-white bg-black">.color-white</div>`
]} />

Behind the scenes, the utilities come together like this:

```css
[class*="color-"] {
  color: var(--bs-text);
}

.color-primary {
  --bs-text: var(--bs-primary);
}
```

## Color opacity

<BreakingChange />

**Color opacity utilities have changed in v6** to use `.color-{number}` instead of `.text-opacity-{number}`. These new utilities are built with CSS-native `color-mix()` functions that mix the `.color-{color}`'s CSS variable with `transparent`. This allows for real-time color opacity changes without compilation.

Note that changing the alpha-transparency or opacity of a color may require you to also update the text color to ensure proper contrast.

<Example code={`<div class="p-2 color-success">.color-success</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-90">.color-90</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-80">.color-80</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-70">.color-70</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-60">.color-60</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-50">.color-50</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-40">.color-40</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-30">.color-30</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-20">.color-20</div>
<div class="p-2 color-success color-10">.color-10</div>`} />

As mentioned above, this works by combining the power of multiple utilities and CSS `color-mix()`. Here's how the compiled CSS looks:

```css
[class*="color-"] {
  color: var(--bs-color);
}

.color-success {
  --bs-color: var(--bs-success);
}

.color-10 {
  color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--bs-color) 10%, transparent);
}
```

## Specificity

Sometimes contextual classes cannot be applied due to the specificity of another selector. In some cases, a sufficient workaround is to wrap your element’s content in a `<div>` or more semantic element with the desired class.

## CSS

In addition to the following Sass functionality, consider reading about our included [CSS custom properties]([[docsref:/customize/css-variables]]) (aka CSS variables) for colors and more.

### Sass variables

Most `color` utilities are generated by our theme colors, reassigned from our generic color palette variables.

<ScssDocs name="theme-colors" file="scss/_theme.scss" />

<ScssDocs name="utils-color" file="scss/_utilities.scss" />

Grayscale colors are also available, but only a subset are used to generate any utilities.

{/* <ScssDocs name="gray-color-variables" file="scss/_variables.scss" /> */}

Variables for setting colors in `.text-*-emphasis` utilities in light and dark mode:

{/* <ScssDocs name="theme-text-variables" file="scss/_variables.scss" /> */}

{/* <ScssDocs name="theme-text-dark-variables" file="scss/_variables-dark.scss" /> */}

### Sass maps

Theme colors are then put into a Sass map so we can loop over them to generate our utilities, component modifiers, and more.

{/* <ScssDocs name="theme-colors-map" file="scss/_variables.scss" /> */}

Grayscale colors are also available as a Sass map. **This map is not used to generate any utilities.**

{/* <ScssDocs name="gray-colors-map" file="scss/_variables.scss" /> */}

RGB colors are generated from a separate Sass map:

{/* <ScssDocs name="theme-colors-rgb" file="scss/_maps.scss" /> */}

Color opacities build on that with their own map that’s consumed by the utilities API:

{/* <ScssDocs name="utilities-text-colors" file="scss/_maps.scss" /> */}

Color mode adaptive text colors are also available as a Sass map:

{/* <ScssDocs name="theme-text-map" file="scss/_maps.scss" /> */}

{/* <ScssDocs name="theme-text-dark-map" file="scss/_maps.scss" /> */}

### Sass utilities API

Color utilities are declared in our utilities API in `scss/_utilities.scss`. [Learn how to use the utilities API.]([[docsref:/utilities/api#using-the-api]])

<ScssDocs name="utils-color" file="scss/_utilities.scss" />
