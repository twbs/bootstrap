Bootstrap doesn't include an icon library by default, but we have a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Preferred
We've tested and used these icon sets ourselves.

- [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open/)
- [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)
- [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/)

## More options
While we haven't tried these out, they do look promising and provide multiple formats—including SVG.

- [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/)
- [Feather](http://colebemis.com/feather/)
