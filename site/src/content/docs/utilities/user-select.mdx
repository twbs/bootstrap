## Overview

Change the way in which the content is selected when the user interacts with it using user-select utilities.

## Basic usage

<Example code={`<p class="user-select-all">This paragraph will be entirely selected when clicked by the user.</p>
<p class="user-select-auto">This paragraph has default select behavior.</p>
<p class="user-select-none">This paragraph will not be selectable when clicked by the user.</p>`} />

## Use cases

- **`.user-select-all`** - Useful for code snippets, IDs, or other content users might want to copy entirely
- **`.user-select-auto`** - Default browser behavior, allows normal text selection
- **`.user-select-none`** - Prevents text selection, useful for UI elements, buttons, or decorative text

<Callout>
**Accessibility note:** Be careful when using `user-select: none` as it can interfere with assistive technologies and keyboard navigation. Ensure that important content remains accessible through other means.

## CSS

### Sass utilities API

User select utilities are declared in our utilities API in `scss/_utilities.scss`. [Learn how to use the utilities API.]([[docsref:/utilities/api#using-the-api]])

```scss
"user-select": (
  property: user-select,
  values: all auto none
),
```
