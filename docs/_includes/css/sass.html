  <p class="lead">While Bootstrap is built on Less, it also has an <a href="{{ site.sass_repo }}">official Sass port</a>. We maintain it in a separate GitHub repository and handle updates with a conversion script.</p>

  <h2 id="sass-contents">What's included</h2>
  <p>Since the Sass port has a separate repo and serves a slightly different audience, the contents of the project differ greatly from the main Bootstrap project. This ensures the Sass port is as compatible with as many Sass-based systems as possible.</p>
