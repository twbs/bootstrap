## Supported browsers

Bootstrap supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. We use a [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) configuration file in the root of our project called [`.browserslistrc`]([[config:repo]]/blob/v[[config:current_version]]/.browserslistrc) to explicitly declare our browser and platform compatibility. This combines with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to generate prefixed CSS properties for browsers as needed.

See the full audience coverage and a more [detailed compatibility report on Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/#q=%3E%3D+0.5%25%0Alast+2+major+versions%0Anot+dead%0AChrome+%3E%3D+105%0AFirefox+%3E%3D+121%0AiOS+%3E%3D+15.4%0ASafari+%3E%3D+15.4%0Anot+Explorer+%3C%3D+11%0Anot+kaios+%3C%3D+2.5).

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform’s web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well.

### Mobile devices

Generally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform’s default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile’s Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk) are not supported.

### Desktop browsers

Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported. Unofficially, Bootstrap should look and behave well enough in Chromium and Chrome for Linux, and Firefox for Linux, though they are not officially supported. Internet Explorer is not supported.

## Modals and dropdowns on mobile

### Overflow and scrolling

Support for `overflow: hidden;` on the `<body>` element is quite limited in iOS and Android. To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of a modal in either of those devices’ browsers, the `<body>` content will begin to scroll. See [Chrome bug #175502](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40301599) (fixed in Chrome v40) and [WebKit bug #153852](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153852).

### iOS text fields and scrolling

As of iOS 9.2, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll gesture is within the boundary of a textual `<input>` or a `<textarea>`, the `<body>` content underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the modal itself. See [WebKit bug #153856](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153856).

### Navbar Dropdowns

The `.dropdown-backdrop` element isn’t used on iOS in the nav because of the complexity of z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you must directly click the dropdown element (or [any other element which will fire a click event in iOS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event#Safari_Mobile)).

## Browser zooming

Page zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some components, both in Bootstrap and the rest of the web. Depending on the issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and then open an issue if need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct solution other than hacky workarounds.

## Validators

Bootstrap uses some browser-specific selectors to provide progressive enhancements and reset some styles across browsers. These may not always pass CSS validators, but they still have a place in real world applications. These validation warnings don’t matter in practice as they don’t interfere with the proper functioning of our styles, and we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.

Likewise, our HTML has some trivial and inconsequential HTML validation warnings. Some of these are also suppressed by our own local configuration and can be ignored.
