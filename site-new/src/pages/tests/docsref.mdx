The accordion uses [collapse]([[docsref:/components/collapse]]) internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion that's expanded, add the `.open` class on the `.accordion`.

- [Snippet examples]([[docsref:/examples#snippets]]) are now ready for dark mode with updated markup and reduced custom styles.

- Added new `.link-body-emphasis` helper alongside our [colored links]([[docsref:/helpers/colored-links]]). This creates a colored link using our color mode responsive emphasis color.

- **Thicker table dividers are now opt-in. —** We've removed the thicker and more difficult to override border between table groups and moved it to an optional class you can apply, `.table-group-divider`. [See the table docs for an example.]([[docsref:/content/tables#table-group-dividers]])

- **Added new snippet examples based to show how to customize our components. —** Pull ready to use customized components and other common design patterns with our new [Snippets examples]([[docsref:/examples#snippets]]). Includes [footers]([[docsref:/examples/footers/]]), [dropdowns]([[docsref:/examples/dropdowns/]]), [list groups]([[docsref:/examples/list-groups/]]), and [modals]([[docsref:/examples/modals/]]).

Once again, this spinner is built with `currentColor`, so you can easily change its appearance with [text color utilities][color]. Here it is in blue, along with the supported variants.

This should also work while embedded in a `<BsTable />` component.

<BsTable class="table table-options">
| Variable | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$enable-rfs` | `true` (default) or `false` | Globally enables [RFS]([[docsref:/getting-started/rfs]]). |
</BsTable>
