A simple shell for an `h1` to appropriately space out and segment sections of content on a page. It can utilize the `h1`'s default `small` element, as well as most other components (with additional styles).

{% example html %}
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Example page header <small>Subtext for header</small></h1>
</div>
{% endexample %}
