**Accessibility tip:** Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies like screen readers. Please ensure the meaning is obvious from the content itself (e.g., the visible text with a [_sufficient_ color contrast](/docs/[[config:docs_version]]/getting-started/accessibility/#color-contrast)) or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.visually-hidden` class.
