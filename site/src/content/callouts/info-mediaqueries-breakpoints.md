**Why subtract .02px?** Browsers donâ€™t currently support [range context queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#range-context), so we work around the limitations of [`min-` and `max-` prefixes](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mq-min-max) and viewports with fractional widths (which can occur under certain conditions on high-dpi devices, for instance) by using values with higher precision.
