[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
=================

Bootstrap provides simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. In other words, it's a front-end toolkit for faster, more beautiful web development. It's created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.

To get started, checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!



Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:twitter/bootstrap.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master).



Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.

Developers
----------

We have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.

+ **build** - `make`
Runs the LESS compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs pages. Requires lessc and uglify-js. <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#compiling">Read more in our docs &raquo;</a>

+ **watch** - `make watch`
This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.
