### **3.2**- October 26, 2012
With this update we've revamped our documentation to be more organized and explain details regarding Scss, Compass and Javascripts.

The updates to Foundation itself are as follows:
* Added [Magellan](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/magellan.php), a plugin for building design agnostic sticky navs that know where you are on the page.
* Added [Joyride](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/joyride.php), our plugin for creating tours of your website or app.
* Added [Clearing](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/clearing.php), our new responsive image gallery lightbox plugin.
* Cleaned up Orbit a bit. We now use opacity on each slide so you don't have stacking problems or different image size problems. You can now optionally stack slides on mobile. Orbit can now be swipeable on mobile as well.
* Updated Reveal
* Updated index files to use defined header and footer structure
* Cleaned up some Compass included
* RTL for ui and navbar.
* Tabs can now use unordered lists or definition lists, replacing the definition title with an li.section-title.
* Added definition list styles.
* Added mobile-#-up classes to use in conjunction with regular block-grid classes for a different mobile grid.
* Updated block grids to be really flexible and customizable based on a variable.
* Added better responsive styling for tooltips.
* Separated all media queries into their own file for easy dropping.
* Updated modular scale to use new functions, doesn't effect end-users.
* Updated visibility classes to use inherit instead of block to accommodate for spans.
* Removed HTML5 Shiv from header since its included in modernizr.
* Added [pricing tables](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/elements.php#pricing-tables) UI element
* Added many new Scss variables to control styling for things like: topbar, clearing, joyride, pricing tables, etc.
* Bug fixes for Topbar.
* Added 5 [HTML templates](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php) to the add-ons section.

### 3.1.1- September 19, 2012
Updating Top Bar navigation implementation pattern to wrap `.contain-to-grid` and/or `.fixed` around the `nav` element to prevent horizontal scroll bars when using `.contain-to-grid`. Updated the topBar breakpoint option so users only need to update the Scss variable.

---

### **3.1**- September 14, 2012
Launched new features, a new Add-ons section to the marketing site, Right to left language support, and fixed bugs.

With this release of Foundation, we include:
* Downloadable HTML template pages that can be copy/pasted into an existing project or added to your project upon downloading from the customizer.
* The Add-on's section includes a round-up of all the playground pieces, etc that aren't officially included in Foundation, but built to work with it. This includes: [Templates](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php), [Icon Fonts](http://foundation.zurb.com/icon-fonts.php), [Off-Canvas Layouts](http://foundation.zurb.com/off-canvas.php), [Responsive Tables](http://foundation.zurb.com/responsive-tables.php), [SVG Social Icons](http://foundation.zurb.com/social-icons.php), and [Omnigraffle Stencils](http://foundation.zurb.com/stencils.php).
* Foundation now includes a [responsive top navigation](http://foundation.zurb.com/navigation.php) bar that lets you have control over when it responds and what you include in it. We've made it really easy to customize using Scss.
* Right-to-left language support straight out of the box. You can adjust this in the settings.scss file or upon downloading with the customizer.
* New UI Styles for Progress Bars and Image Thumbs.
* Updated to include jQuery 1.8.1
* Orbit thumbnail documentation.
* Better Reveal size documentation.

### 3.0.6- July 20, 2012
Numerous bugfixes including dropdown buttons on touch devices, Modernizr update with IE8Compat, split button colors, and more. Split out the functions in app.js to be part of the Gem and only initialized in app.js, so you can keep a clean distinction between your JS and Foundation's (if you want to). Added an [accordion](http://foundation.zurb.com/elements.php) element.

### 3.0.5- July 10, 2012
Fixed Compass performance issues by separating out each Foundation file and removing extraneous imports.

* Added error states back to the forms documentation.
* Flyouts in a nav bar can now expand up as well as down.
* In SCSS you can now set $base-size correctly, but we're still working to correct modifying the $ratio variable.
