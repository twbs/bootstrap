## Core concepts

- **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.** Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.

- **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.** Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.

- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.

## Available breakpoints

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as _grid tiers_, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

<BsTable>
| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | <em>None</em> |&lt;576px |
| Small | `sm` | &ge;576px |
| Medium | `md` | &ge;768px |
| Large | `lg` | &ge;1024px |
| Extra large | `xl` | &ge;1280px |
| Extra extra large | `2xl` | &ge;1536px |
</BsTable>

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.

These breakpoints are customizable via Sass—you’ll find them in a Sass map in our `_variables.scss` stylesheet.

## Media queries

Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.

### Min-width

Bootstrap primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.

```scss
// Source mixins

// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it’s effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(2xl) { ... }

// Usage

// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint
.custom-class {
  display: none;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

These Sass mixins translate in our compiled CSS using the values declared in our Sass variables. For example:

```scss
// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (width >= 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (width >= 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 1024px and up)
@media (width >= 1024px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1280px and up)
@media (width >= 1280px) { ... }

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1536px and up)
@media (width >= 1536px) { ... }
```

### Max-width

We occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size _or smaller_):

```scss
// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it’s effectively `@media (max-width: 0) { ... }`
@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(2xl) { ... }

// Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down
@include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

These mixins use the breakpoint values to create `max-width` media queries using modern range syntax. For example:

```scss
// `xs` returns only a ruleset and no media query
// ... { ... }

// `sm` applies to x-small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
@media (width < 576px) { ... }

// `md` applies to small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)
@media (width < 768px) { ... }

// `lg` applies to medium devices (tablets, less than 1024px)
@media (width < 1024px) { ... }

// `xl` applies to large devices (desktops, less than 1280px)
@media (width < 1280px) { ... }

// `2xl` applies to x-large devices (large desktops, less than 1536px)
@media (width < 1536px) { ... }
```

### Single breakpoint

There are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.

```scss
@include media-breakpoint-only(xs) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(2xl) { ... }
```

For example the `@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }` will result in :

```scss
@media (width >= 768px) and (width < 992px) { ... }
```

### Between breakpoints

Similarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths:

```scss
@include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }
```

Which results in:

```scss
// Example
// Apply styles starting from medium devices and up to extra large devices
@media (width >= 768px) and (width < 1200px) { ... }
```
